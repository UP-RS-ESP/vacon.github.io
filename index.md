![image-left](/images/NWArg_GNSS_VACON_fixedSA.jpg){: .align-left} VACON - The *VAlles Calchaquíes Observatory Network* is a network of continuous GNSS stations and meteorological instruments in Northwestern Argentina. The instruments are in the Valles Calchaquies and adjacent areas. Currently there are 13 stations installed and the first station was installed in February 2024. 

There are multiple scientific goals of the VACON network: 
  - The GNSS data are used to better understand deformation processes in the Central Andes.
  - The meteorological data with high temporal resolution is used to quantify and characterize rapid weather changes.
  - The GNSS data are computed to integrated water vapour amount to delineate three dimensional water-vapour transport.
