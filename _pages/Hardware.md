Our system is built around high-quality sensors, with data logging and real-time access managed by a Raspberry Pi 3+. We deliberately use the older Raspberry Pi 3+ model due to its lower power consumption, which we also monitor as part of the setup. Real-time data is available for most sites via local Wi-Fi or a SIM connection.

The GNSS component is the Septentrio Mosaic X5, a compact multi-constellation receiver module, typically paired with a Harxon GPS 1000 survey antenna. Meteorological data are collected using a Bosch BMP388 (barometric pressure and altitude) and an ASAIR temperature sensor, with data processing handled by an Adafruit Feather.

All software was developed at the University of Potsdam.
